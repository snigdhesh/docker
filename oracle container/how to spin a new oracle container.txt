Intro:
Free database image from "container-registry.oracle.com"

Note:
In documentation it says podman, you can replace "docker" instead of "podman"

How to get started:

Use following command
docker run -p 1521:1521 --name oracle-local container-registry.oracle.com/database/free:latest

After few min, you should be able to connect from your sql-client with following details

url: jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:FREE
username: SYS AS SYSDBA
password:               //This password will be empty.

If it says invalid credentails, try setting up a password using following command

docker exec <container_id> ./setPassword.sh <new_password>

Now, use your new password and connect with above details.

Now run following command to create user (without any rules)
change session to pdb: 
	alter session set container=freepdb1;
	
	create user <user_name> identified by <password>; //user_name=test_admin and password=admin
	
	grant dba to test_admin;

Now you should be able to create tables and all using following connection details;

url: jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521/freepdb1
username: test_admin
password: admin
